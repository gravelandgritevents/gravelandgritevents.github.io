      <h2>What is a Backyard Ultra?</h2>
      <p>
        The Bristol Backyard Ultra is not a typical ultramarathon. It is a simple, relentless test of patience,
        pacing, and mental resolve, set within the historic parkland and woodland trails of Blaise Castle Estate
        in Bristol.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>There is no finish line to chase, no target time, and no fixed distance.</strong> Just a loop, a
        bell, and one question asked again every hour: <em>can you go again?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Runners complete a 4.167-mile (6.7 km) trail loop every hour, on the hour. You have 60 minutes to complete
        each loop. Finish early and you rest. Finish late, or fail to make the start line when the bell rings, and
        your race is over.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event repeats hour after hour and continues until only one runner remains. That final runner must
        complete one last solo loop to be crowned <strong>Last One Standing</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every other participant, regardless of distance covered, is recorded as a DNF. This is not a race about
        speed. It is about pacing, recovery, decision-making, and managing the mental challenge of repetition.
      </p>

    <section id="course">
      <h2>The Course</h2>
      <p>
        The course is 4.167 miles (6.7 km) long and winds through the varied trails of <strong>Blaise Castle Estate</strong>,
        combining woodland paths, babbling brooks, and open parkland.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elevation varies between long flat sections, gentle climbs and descents, plus one killer hill on the route up
        to the castle. The loop is fully marked and easy to follow, so runners can focus solely on completing each lap
        and returning to the start before the next bell.
